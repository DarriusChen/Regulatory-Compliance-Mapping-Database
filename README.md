# Regulatory-Compliance-Mapping-Database
This project is aim to create a database of the mapping between different Regulatory Compliance Standards, and make a convenient searching function.

### GraphQL server
Use case: search data in SQLite database using gql.
Run `npm start` to launch the server, and then there will be a playground at port 4000.
You can try different functions you want, type the columns to query, and the variable you want to filter.

In the example above, what I did is query the column "csf_f_ID", and "csf_f_name" if the value "csf_f_ID" is equal to "ID"
